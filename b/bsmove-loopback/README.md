# BS MOVE BACKEND

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

* launch mongo deamon as a DEAMON.
```
mongod
```

* launch mongo shell
```
mongo
```

If everything is set correctly you should be prompted with mongo shell.

* create mongo admin user
```
use bsmove
db.createUser({ user: "admin", pwd: "rootisroot", roles: ["userAdmin", "dbAdmin", "readWrite"] });
```

If everything executed as intended, you should see "Successfully created an user." message on mongo shell.
